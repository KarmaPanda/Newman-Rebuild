                        <Col>
                            <p>The Catholic Newman Community is indebted to those who have given to the George Eastman Circle (GEC) in support of Newman&rsquo;s pastoral presence on campus. As the University&rsquo;s premier giving society, and by committing to a pledge for five consecutive years, GEC members offer us a tangible and hearty vote of confidence for the enriching work we accomplish every day. Theirs is an example of historic commitment that not only helps us to support the incredible students who grace our presence, but such donors also allow us to better project, plan, and initiate new and exciting ways of doing ministry on an annual basis. </p>
                            <p>Those who wish to give to Newman through the George Eastman Circle must specifically designate their gift to the Catholic Newman Community/Dean&rsquo;s Fund for Newman Community. </p>
                            <p>GEC donors are afforded many benefits as befits such an honored giving society. They not only receive special recognition from both the University and Newman, but they receive countless gifts; are able to attend special lectures, gatherings, and events; and enjoy the esteemed privilege of serving on leadership councils/volunteer committees across the United States. Members truly become an integral part of the fabric that makes up not only the University community, but which exude the Christian qualities of hospitality and solidarity that Newman holds dear. </p>
                            <p>We thank you once again if you have already dedicated your GEC contribution to Newman! However, if you just begun to think about the process or would like to learn more about dedicating your gifts to Newman through the George Eastman Circle, please see some helpful links below.</p>
