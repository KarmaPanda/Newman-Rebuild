                            <p>Newman Stephen Ministers are students-Christian men and women-trained to provide one-to-one care to fellow students experiencing a difficult time in life, such as grief, a break-up, changing majors, uncertainties of life, chronic or terminal illness in the family, cultural adjustment, etc.</p>
                            <p>In the summer of 2016, the Newman Community certified Stephen Leaders through 50 hours of training. Through this training, these students have grown in their caregiving capacity to learn more about how to be compassionate, trustworthy, skilled, full of faith, and Christ centered. These ministers are well equipped to provide high quality, distinctively Christian care to the University of Rochester community.</p>
